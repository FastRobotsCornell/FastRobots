# Lab 6: Orientation Control

## Objective
The purpose of this lab is to get experience with orientation PID using the IMU. In [Lab 5](Lab5.md), PID control was done on wall distance using the TOF sensors, this lab will involve controlling the yaw of your robot using the IMU. Like last lab, you can pick whatever controller works best for your system. 4000-level students can choose between P, PI, PID, PD; 5000-level students can choose between PI and PID controllers. Your hand-in will be judged upon your demonstrated understanding of PID control and practical implementation constraints, and the quality of your solution. 

This lab is part of a series of labs (5-8) on PID control, sensor fusion, and stunts.

## Lab Procedure

### Orientation Control

For this task, you will have the robot drive fast forward toward a wall, then turn with drift to do a 180 degree turn, and return in the direction it came from without stopping. The PID controller should be controlling the orientation of your robot by introducing a difference in motor speeds. Before trying to get your car to drift, try controlling the orientation of your car while it is stationary, then introduce a base speed. To make your data useful for lab 7, be sure to start 4m from a wall and get within 1m before turning. 

Beyond the considerations mentioned above, think about the following:
  - How do you get the orientation of the robot? How can you minimize the error introduced by discrete integration of the gyroscope? 
  - How fast is your robot turning? You may have to check whether you are maxing out the gyroscope. The library will allow you to adjust the range. 
  - The PID controller should control an “offset” or differential in wheel speed. That way you can control the orientation even if the car is moving at a set base speed.

Below you can see an example of the controller maintaining a constant orientation even when the robot is kicked.

Below is an example of the robot drifting and doing a 180 degree turn as well as graphs of the setpoint, angle, and control signal for the PID controller.

## Tasks for 5000-level students
   
Implement wind-up protection for your integrator. Argue for why this is necessary (you may for example demonstrate how your controller works reasonably independent of floor surface).

**Webpage Sections**

This is not a strict requirement, but may be helpful in understanding what should be included in your webpage. It also helps with the flow of your report to show your understanding to the lab graders. *This lab is more open ended in terms of the steps taken to reach the end goal, so just make sure to document your process you take to complete your task, including testing and debugging steps!*

1. Prelab
   * Clearly describe how you handle sending and receiving data over Bluetooth
   * Consider adding code snippets as necessary to showcase how you implemented this on Arduino and Python

2. Lab Tasks
   * P/I/D discussion (Kp/Ki/Kd values chosen, why you chose a combination of controllers, etc.)
   * Range/Sampling time discussion
   * Graphs, code, videos, images, discussion of reaching task goal 
   * Graph data should at least include theta vs time (you can also consider angular velocity, motor input, etc)
   * (5000) Wind-up implementation and discussion
   
Add code (consider using [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com)) where you think is relevant (DO NOT paste your entire code).
